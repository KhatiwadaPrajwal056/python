#list and tuples
#list are the containers to store a set of valus of any data types(collection of datatypes)a compplex data type, its like an array
'''
a=[1,5,4,6,8]
x,y,z=a #unpacking
print(a)
print(a[0:2]) prints 1,5
# slicing of list can also be done same like string slicing
THEY ARE MUTABLE:
IMPORTANT:: 

#list functions/methods
a.sort() #sorts the list
print(a)
a.reverse() #reverses the lists
print(a)
a.append(45) # adds at the end of the list
print(a)
a.insert(0,55) #inserts to the list (position, item)
print(a)
a.pop(0) #removes element at the given position of the list
print(a)
a.remove(45) #removes the particular element of the list
print(a)
a.clear()  #clears entire list

# list comprehension 
#square of num to 10:
num=[i**2 for i in range(1,11)]
print(num



# Tuples , It is an immutable (cannot be changed )data type in python, Once a tuples is defined it can't be altered or manipulated
a=(1,2,3) #tuple with numerious elements
x,y,z = a # unpacking
a=() # empty tuple
a=(1) # wrong way to declare tuple with single element
a=(1,) # correct way to declare tuple with single element
b=(3,5,6,8,1,1,1,12,4)
print(b.count(1)) #counts the occurances of the particular element '''
